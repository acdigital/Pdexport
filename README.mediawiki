<li>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why do all PDFs have the same filename?</dt><dd>When I originally made the plugin, the PDFs were named after the post they came from, but due to difficulties, I had to use DOMPDF in a different way. Because of this, some things mentioned in usage guides did not work, because they were deprecated.</dd>
